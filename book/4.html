<div>

		The if block in lines 2-6 attempts to obtain the child element if it exists. This is just in case the user has already removed the child div and is reattempting to it. In this case, a JavaScript error would normally pop up because the child div does not exist.     
	</p>
	<p>
  	If the child element does exist, the first thing that we do is obtain the child element in line 3 using the child div id. Next, we do the same thing with the parent element by using the parent div id Lastly, we invoke the removeChild method from the parent element and pass the child element as the argument. Thatâ€™s it!
